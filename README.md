# Petrol Price Forecasting Using LSTM

## Overview:
The Petrol Price Forecasting with LSTM project aims to predict future petrol prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). Predicting petrol prices is essential for various stakeholders, including consumers, businesses, and policymakers, as it helps in making informed decisions related to budgeting, investment, and policy planning.

## Key Features:

### Data Collection: 
The project involves collecting historical petrol price data from reliable sources, such as government agencies, petroleum industry reports, or public datasets.

### Data Preprocessing: 
The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any other anomalies. It includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to make it suitable for training the LSTM model.

### LSTM Model: 
The core of the project is the implementation of an LSTM neural network for time series forecasting. TensorFlow or PyTorch can be used for building and training the LSTM model. Hyperparameter tuning may be employed to optimize the model's performance.

### Model Training: 
The LSTM model is trained on the historical petrol price dataset, utilizing a portion of the data for training and another portion for validation. The model is adjusted iteratively to improve its accuracy.

### Evaluation Metrics: 
Various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.

### Visualization: 
Visualizations, such as line charts, can be generated to compare the predicted petrol prices against the actual prices. This aids in understanding how well the model is capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

### Forecasting: 
Once the model is trained and validated, it can be used to make future predictions of petrol prices. These forecasts can be presented in a user-friendly format, possibly through a web interface or API.

### Dependencies:
Python,
TensorFlow,
Pandas,
NumPy,
Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization
